# Go C++
:point_right: [**navining.gitbook.io/gocpp**](https://navining.gitbook.io/gocpp/)

C++ basics improvement, object-oriented paradigm and advanced programming techniques, along with classic interview questions and practical problem-solving examples.

Relevant code is on [Github](https://github.com/navining/gocpp). Please give me a star if you benifit from it!

:grinning: These notes are forï¼š
1. People who have already learned C and want to learn C++
2. People who already know C++ and want to learn in depth
3. People who are preparing for recruitment and want to crack the technical interviews (like me)
4. People who want to use C++ in practical projects and want to know about common programming techniques

:slightly_frowning_face: These notes are not for:
1. People who have no programming experience with C-style programming languages
2. People who want to delve into the details of C++ standards

**Have fun!**
